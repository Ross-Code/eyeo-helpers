# Eyeo helpers

## Introduction

![Eyeo](/src/icons/detailed/eyeo-64.png)

Eyeo helpers is a small Chrome extension that contains tools to
help make our jobs at Eyeo easier. Pull requests welcome if you have any
ideas for what else this extension could do.

## Installation

[Download the eyeo-helpers.crx extension file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kzar/eyeo-helpers/master/eyeo-helpers.crx),
open the Chrome extensions settings page and then drag and drop the file
onto the page.

## Trac user prediction

The extension helps speed up and improve the suggestions when typing
user names into the CC / Assignee fields in our issue tracker
https://issues.adblockplus.org .

So far the search algorithm I've implemented is pretty simplistic, but
it still seems to work better than the default. I'll likely have a go
at making the predictions more intelligent in the future.

## Updates

Once installed the extension should keep itself updated automatically.
I'm hoping we can add more useful functionality in the future.
